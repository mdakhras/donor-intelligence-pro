Democrat Mette Frederiksen, is a coalition between the Soc​ial Democrats
(centre-left), the Liberals (centre-right) and the Moderates (new centrist
party). This is a ‘centrist’ government, established following the Nov. 2022
elections, that breaks the traditional left-right political divide for the
first time since 1978 (The Social Democrats and Liberals have only governed
together once before, for just over a year in 1978-1979).&#160;The coalition government
formed at the end of 2022 lost its parliamentary majority due to some
defections and August 2024, the Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen appointed six
new ministers in a major cabinet reshuffle, bringing the number of ministers to
25, the largest ever in 30 years.&#160;The current government retains a restrictive
view of migration policy albeit with adjustments in some areas, as for example
flexibility on conditions for regulations on labour migration. Regarding the
Russia-Ukraine conflict, Denmark has maintained a supportive stance towards
Ukraine, aligning with European Union policies. The Danish government has
emphasized the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity, reflecting
its broader foreign policy principles.&#160;In early January 2025, Greenland's
Prime Minister, Múte Egede, announced intentions to hold a referendum on
independence from Denmark. This development has significant implications for
Denmark's territorial integrity and its geopolitical stance in the Arctic
region, especially considering the declared actions of U.S. President Donald
Trump, who had declared his readiness to consider annexing the region for
national security reasons.</div><div class=""ExternalClassDDF21F879AFB4B42AA12C068D95A1B49""><div><span style=""font-size&#58;11pt;""></span>","</div></div><div>Since 1978, Denmark has provided at least 0.7% of its GNI as ODA, in

Australia’s population&#160;was 26,638,544 people as of 30 June 2023 (annual growth was&#160;624,100 people (2.4%)&#58; annual natural increase was 106,100 and&#160;net overseas migration was 518,100) living mainly in the coastal&#160;regions. By way of comparison, Australia covers almost twice the&#160;area of the European Union. The Australian government is a&#160;parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy and&#160;recognizes the British Monarch as its sovereign. As such, King Charles III is the Head of State. The Prime&#160;Minister is the Head of the Government. Since 2022, Australia is led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese&#160;and the Australian Labor Party.</div><div><br></div><div>The country has six states and ten territories. Australia’s capital is Canberra, located in the southeast&#160;between the larger and more important economic and cultural centres of Sydney and Melbourne. The&#160;country is one of the major advanced economies globally experiencing 27 years of uninterrupted economic&#160;growth. The main drivers of growth were elevated net migration, resilient private investment, and strong&#160;public investment in transport, health, education, and national defence.&#160;Australia is a culturally diverse country, with an important heritage from its Indigenous population,&#160;representing 3.8% of the total Australian population. Over 30 per cent of the Australian resident&#160;population were born overseas and around 45 per cent report having at least one parent who was born&#160;overseas. More than 300 languages are spoken in Australian homes. The top five (excluding English) are&#160;Mandarin, Arabic, Cantonese, Vietnamese and Italian.<p>In the May 2025 federal election, the Albanese-led Labor government was re-elected with an increased majority. Labor’s continued leadership ensures stability in its ongoing migration reforms, including the implementation of the 2023 Migration Strategy and expanded regional and skills-based pathways.</p></div><div>In September
2022, the government increased the permanent migration intake to a record
195,000 per year to address workforce shortages. However, by December 2023, a
ten-year migration strategy was announced, aiming to overhaul the immigration
system. As the federal election approaches, migration policy has become a focal
point of political debate. Opposition leader has proposed reducing the
permanent migration program to 140,000, a move criticized by experts as
potentially unattainable and harmful to Australia's economy due to the
significant tax contributions of skilled migrants.<p>Whilst the
current Government has taken a more encouraging approach towards overseas
development funding, the focus has largely been funding to the Pacific
countries.</p><p>The Australian
Government’s migration, humanitarian, and development priorities are outlined
in three key policy documents&#58;</p></div><div><ul><li>Migration Strategy (2023) focuses on reforming Australia’s migration system to
address skills shortages, regional workforce needs, and visa integrity, while
also tackling migrant worker exploitation and enhancing pathways for permanent
residency.</li><li>Humanitarian Policy (2024) underscores Australia’s commitment to saving lives, alleviating
suffering, and building resilience through targeted humanitarian aid, conflict
prevention, and disaster preparedness, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.</li><li>Australian Development Priorities
(2023) provides a structured approach to
Australia’s foreign aid, ensuring that development assistance aligns with
national priorities, delivers measurable outcomes, and strengthens
partnerships. Collectively, these policies prioritize Indo-Pacific stability, climate
resilience, gender equality, humanitarian assistance, trade and economic

with 75% of total aid&#160;directed to the region—the highest proportion
in four decades. Within this, the Pacific will receive 42% of total aid ($2.157 billion), reinforcing Australia’s
focus on its closest neighbours. An additional $1 billion over five years&#160;will
be invested in boosting economic resilience across the Indo-Pacific, while $355
million over four years&#160;will go towards responding to climate-related

promotion of human rights as well as international humanitarian and refugee
law, key tenets of Switzerland’s foreign policy in all its endeavors. In
particular, the GPMFD is committed to preventing, mitigating and responding to
the risks and consequences of violence, coercion, deliberate deprivation and
abuse for vulnerable migrants and displacement-affected communities. While the
GPMFD focused predominantly on labor migration issues during the implementation
of previous program frameworks, it has become clear that such a concentration
can be limiting. A more comprehensive definition of migration, including
aspects of forced displacement, is necessary – both from a conceptual
perspective, acknowledging the often blurred boundaries between forced
displacement and irregular migration, as well as from an operational
perspective, with a view to furthering the humanitarian-development-peace nexus
and inclusive area-based approaches.&#160;</span></p></span></div><div style=""text-align&#58;left;""><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;"">The GPMFD has already started to
substantially expand the geographic reach of its programmatic interventions,
with several new programs in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in North Africa,
Russia and Central Asia. In the future, the GPMFD will further increase its
efforts to mobilize other development partners, public and private, to leverage
the sustainability of programs’ long-term impact. A positive lesson from the
past four years concerns the relevance of Switzerland’s unique whole-of-government approach (WOGA) to
international migration cooperation. The substantial time investment by the
GPMFD to coordinate with different governmental actors in Switzerland is
considered worthwhile, as this coordination and cooperation has been
instrumental in conceptualizing the strategic link between international
cooperation and migration policy and in assuring policy coherence in
Switzerland’s foreign migration policy.</span></div><div style=""text-align&#58;left;""><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;"">Good to revise this&#160;</span><a href=""https&#58;//www.sdc-migration.ch/en/policy-engagement""><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;"">Policy Engagement</span></a><br></div>","[""Cross-Cutting: Equality, diversity, and inclusion"",""Cross-Cutting: Environmental Sustainability"",""Durable Solutions"",""Emergency Response"",""Environment and Climate Change"",""Labour Migration, Integration and Social Cohesion"",""Peace-building, Conflict Prevention and Resolution"",""Community Stabilization"",""Cross-Cutting: Protection-centred Approaches"",""climate change and displacement""]","<div><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;"">SDC has a network of migration and displacement practitioners for Swiss officials.</span></div><div><div><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;""><p><span style=""font-size&#58;11pt;"">More information about SDC can be found down bellow&#58;&#160;</span></p></span></div><div><ul><li><a href=""https&#58;//www.sdc-migration.ch/en/priority-topics""><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;"">Priority Topics</span></a></li><li><a href=""https&#58;//www.sdc-migration.ch/en/new-resources-on""><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;"">Thematic Integration Brief on Climate Change, DRR, Environment and Migration</span></a></li></ul></div></div><div><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;"">2025's New International Cooperation strategy can be found here&#58;&#160;</span><a href=""https&#58;//www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/fdfa/fdfa/aktuell/dossiers/iza-strategie-2025-28.html""><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;"">International Cooperation (IC) Strategy 2025–28</span></a><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;"">&#160;</span><br></div><div><br></div><div class=""ExternalClass2FC77BE3E0D3476E8CAFD8EC7F5CCA8B""><div></div><div class=""ExternalClassB22E712216904694811191BD5DD9C2E2""><div style=""font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);""><a href=""file&#58;///C&#58;/Users/cnehme/Downloads/Flyer-Strategie-IZA-2025_EN.pdf""></a></div></div></div>","[""Middle East and North Africa"",""East, Horn and Southern Africa"",""Europe and Central Asia""]","<div><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;"">The four priority regions of the 2021–24 strategy

In line with Switzerland’s foreign policy identity, this strategy reaffirms Switzerland’s shared responsibility in Europe as well as its role as an advocate of global understanding. In particular, Switzerland's foreign policy strategy emphasizes a stable and prosperous Europe, with a focus on strengthening relations with the EU, contributing to European security, and supporting Ukraine's reconstruction. While maintaining a global perspective, Switzerland recognizes the shift to a less Western-centric world and the importance of constructive relations with all regions, especially the G20 states. The country seeks to reform multilateral systems, promote peace, enhance security cooperation with the EU and NATO, and adapt its diplomatic efforts to new challenges like science diplomacy. According to the FPS, a series of measures will be introduced to make foreign policy more coherent. Moreover, a broad network and instruments geared to current requirements are essential to safeguard interests effectively. One such instrument is neutrality. Neutrality does not mean indifference. It leaves room for the sort of cooperative foreign and security policy that is outlined in the FPS and also for extensive solidarity with partners as far as the law of neutrality permits. The Federal Council situates neutrality in the world’s current political landscape within the framework of the FPS and categorizes the issues arising in this regard.</p></div><div>The FDFA's

(SE) government is a coalition between the Moderate party (centre-right), the
Christian Democrats (centre-right to right-wing) and the Liberals
(centre-right). This is a minority government which depends on parliamentary
support from the Sweden Democrats (far-right populist party). The Sweden
Democrats are not formally part of the government but are heavily involved in
the elaboration of its policies. In this way, SE that has been otherwise known
for its long history of social democratic governments is undergoing a
significant shift to the right. The political agreement negotiated between
these 4 parties (i.e. the coalition parties + Sweden Democrats) after the 2022
election, known as the Tidö agreement, appoints Ulf Kristersson of the Moderate
Party as Prime Minister and his Cabinet as the Government of Sweden.&#160; Following the retirement of Foreign Minister
Tobias Billström and the appointment of Jessika Roswall as European
Commissioner, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson reorganized the government
in September 2024. Roswall was replaced as Minister of EU Affairs and Nordic
Cooperation by Jessica Rosencrantz. Billström was replaced as Foreign Minister
by Maria Malmer Stenergard. Johan Pehrson and Mats Persson also switched places
as ministers of employment and education.</div><div><br></div><div>After Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine, Sweden abandoned its tradition of neutrality and applied
to become a member of NATO, although there were tensions with Turkey over
Sweden’s protection of Kurdish refugees. Finally, at the end of 2023, the
Turkish parliament's foreign affairs committee sent the request to the National
Assembly for final approval. After another stall due to Hungary’s opposition,
on 7 March 2024, Sweden finally became a full member of NATO.</div><div><div><br></div></div><div>The Swedish economy
is very open to foreign trade, which represents 106% of its GDP (World Bank –
latest data available). Sweden has a structurally positive trade balance&#58; in
2023, the country recorded a trade surplus accounting for nearly 4% of its GDP (from
1.9% one year earlier - World Bank). The European Union is Sweden's largest
trading partner (54.2% of exports and 66.9% of imports according to Statistics
Sweden).</div><div class=""ExternalClassF4CA1BD16EBA4209A719CA33310CCB68""><div>","<div><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;""><b>Decrease ODI spending</b></span><span style=""font-family&#58;calibri;font-size&#58;11pt;"">&#58; SE has traditionally been among
     the few countries who kept&#160;the&#160;ODI’s share&#160;at 1%
     of&#160;its GNI. The current Government has decoupled ODI from GNI and
     abandoned the 1% target (SE’s ODI budget for 2023 accounted for 0.88% of
     GNI). The Government also proposed to fix the ODI amount for three years
     to make spending more predictable and allow the MFA and Sida to reliably
     plan spending over the medium-term. The Government has also decided to
     make parts of aid conditional on the willingness of partner countries to cooperate
     on return and readmission of rejected asylum seekers. The core support is
     also being redirected from multilateral organisations to civil society.

top foreign policy priority is supporting Ukraine. This includes political,
humanitarian, military, and financial aid, with a total of around SEK 70 billion
since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. Sweden views this support as a

The agreement between the coalition members was formalised in a document entitled the ‘Hurdal Platform’ (‘<a href=""https&#58;//www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/hurdalsplattformen/id2877252/"">Hurdalsplattformen</a>’ in Norwegian). This is a minority government that relies on the support from the Socialist Left Party (SV). After the September 2021 elections, the Labour party together with the Centre and the left-leaning Socialist parties secured the majority, ending 8 years of conservative rule. However, the Socialists parties withdrew from negotiations after preliminary talks revealed divisions between the parties on climate policy, Norway’s oil industry and tax policy. While the SV as a support party has had some impact on the policies of the current NO Government, overall, the current coalition Government is less left-leaning than previous Labour-led governments. Having the Centre Party in the government has been somewhat of a wild card, especially given its recent populist tendencies, especially when it comes to climate and migration policies. With a rural support base (previously called the farmers party) this party has played up narratives critiquing the ‘urban elites’.<br></div>","<div>Norway’s development programme focuses on food security, climate, health, inequality, and sexual and reproductive rights. An increasing share of the budget is also spent on humanitarian assistance.

international commitments and <a href=""https&#58;//www.gco.gov.qa/en/about-qatar/national-vision2030/"">Qatar National Vision 2030</a> objectives. Qatar has implemented
substantial reforms to its labor laws in the past years to enhance the
protection of the rights and well-being of migrant workers, ensuring they are
treated fairly and with dignity. These included the abolition of the Kafala
(sponsorship system), which previously tied workers to their employers, as well
as the establishment of minimum wage standards (including for domestic
workers), and new provisions focused on workers’ welfare and safety. The reform
agenda is part of an ongoing multi-year technical cooperation with ILO since
2018. Qatar is closely monitoring issues related to forced labor and human
trafficking, demonstrating a strong commitment to addressing these serious
concerns.</p><p>As of 2023, Qatar's GDP is estimated at $213 billion USD.&#160;&#160;&#160;The country's GDP growth rate for the same year was approximately 1.19%&#58;&#160;<a href=""https&#58;//data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=QA"">https&#58;//data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=QA</a>.</p></div>","<div>Qatar's ODA is primarily provided

The combined left obtained less than one-third of the seats in parliament. For the first time, the Geert Wilders party (PVV), known for its far-right and anti-migration stance, has delivered ministers, including the Minister for Asylum and Migration, Ms. Faber, and the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, Ms. Klever, both of whom are key to IOM.<p>Minister Faber has introduced severe budget cuts, reducing the migration budget from 9.8 billion EUR to 2.9 billion EUR by 2027, based on the assumption that current measures will reduce or stop migration flows to the Netherlands. However, all new laws still need to be passed through both Parliament and the Senate, and it is unlikely that coalition partners NSC and VVD will agree with some of the new laws and policies, making the current coalition highly unstable.</p><p>Ms. Klever became responsible for the MFA ODA portfolio, which includes most of IOM's Dutch funding outside of KNL, including the COMPASS program. Ms. Klever will have to cut EUR 2.4 billion of development aid funding per year from 2027 onwards. She has already announced a budget cut for NGOs and civil society organizations from EUR 1.4 billion to 400 million for their next funding cycle (2026-2028). Although this is likely to affect IOM's programs, there are also opportunities. Under the new cabinet, the Minister has decided to create a new Directorate of International Migration (DIM) that will oversee COMPASS funding and all other international migration-related programs funded by the Dutch, such as the Prospect for Refugees and host communities. It is likely that such a new directorate will come with stable funding opportunities.</p></div>","<p style=""margin&#58;0in 0in 8pt;line-height&#58;107%;font-size&#58;11pt;font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""""></span></p></div></div><div>ODA&#160;is

His tenure as Prosecutor General involved high-profile investigations, including one against former President Park Geun-Hye, leading to her impeachment. Initially favored by the liberal Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), Yoon's relationship with them soured in 2020, culminating in his resignation and entry into the presidential race in 2021 under PPP's banner.</div><div><p><b>Martial Law Declaration</b>&#58; On 3 December 2024, President Yoon declared emergency martial law, accusing the DPK of anti-state activities and legislative obstruction, including the impeachment of key government officials and rejection of the budget. His administration, however, faced internal controversies, including a corruption scandal involving the First Lady. The declaration led to opposition protests and a resolution passed by the National Assembly to lift the martial law within hours. President Yoon later apologized for the declaration.</p><p><b>Impeachment Proceedings</b>&#58; On 4 December 2024, the DPK initiated impeachment proceedings against President Yoon, accusing him of constitutional violations, insurrection, and abuse of power. Although the initial resolution failed, internal dissent within PPP led to the passing of the impeachment motion on 14 December, with 204 National Assembly members voting in favor. The President was suspended from office, with Prime Minister Han Duk-Soo assuming the role of Acting President. Subsequently, Han also faced impeachment for blocking investigations. The Constitutional Court is currently reviewing the impeachment, requiring a decision within 180 days.</p></div><div><b>Arrest of the President</b>&#58; On 31 December 2024, the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO) issued an arrest warrant for President Yoon on charges related to leading an insurrection. After failed attempts to arrest him in early January 2025, the President was eventually detained on 15 January following a second warrant. After 52 days in custody, Yoon was released on 8 March 2025.<p><b>Constitutional Court Hearings</b>&#58; Eleven impeachment hearings took place in early 2025, involving testimonies from various high-ranking officials. Key allegations centered on procedural flaws in the cabinet meeting that declared martial law and an alleged attempt to seize the National Assembly. President Yoon defended his actions, claiming no procedural violations and asserting that the martial law declaration was meant to address national security concerns, not to suppress political opposition. The National Assembly's representative argued that Yoon violated constitutional provisions by declaring martial law without emergency justification and attempting to seize legislative authority. A final ruling is expected in March 2025, with new elections to be held if Yoon's removal is confirmed.</p><p><b>Impact on Liaison</b>&#58;&#160;Appointment and rotation of senior government officials are put on hold. Potential early elections and change of ruling party may affect the ODA implementation plan and following strategies.</p></div>","<div>ROK is ranked as the 14th largest ODA donor and&#160;has continuously increased its Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget.

Every five years, in coordination with other central government stakeholders, MOJ announces “Master Plan for Policies on Foreigners” which serves as a national plan and guideline on ROK migration policy. To break down existing silos in migration policy development, the 4th Master Plan for years 2023 to 2027 emphasizes the whole-of-government approach to promote social integration and protection of migrants, as well as to foster economic and regional development through migration.&#160;<br></div>","<div>Since 2015, IOM ROK has supported MOJ-KIS in operating the refugee resettlement programme by providing Pre-Departure Orientation (PDO), pre-departure health assessment, and movement assistance. The programme benefits around 30 refugees from Myanmar every year, and the caseload volume has remained unchanged. IOM in partnership with UNHCR and CSOs in ROK has and will continue to emphasize the need to increase the volume and importance of diversifying the beneficiary profile.&#160;&#160;</div><div><p>In 2019, based on the MOU with MOJ-KIS, IOM started operating Korea Visa Application Centres (KVACs) in Europe and Mongolia based on its expertise in immigration and visa support. In the beginning, the operation was largely affected by COVID-19 but now has fully recovered. In 2023, KVAC supported 194,000 visa applicants in Mongolia and Europe i.e. Paris, London, Berlin, and the Hague.3 IOM ROK liaises with MOJ-KIS to feed GOK’s changing border governance policies and trends to the KVAC programme as well as address any challenges the donor is experiencing. Continuing the KVAC programme is critical for IOM in that by enhancing transparency and efficiency in the visa application procedures, the migrants can be protected from unscrupulous visa brokers and agencies, and the operation itself can serve as an opportunity for IOM to showcase its expertise and vision in well-managed regular migration pathways by providing practical support to the donor government.&#160;&#160;</p></div><div><br></div>","<div>Contact IOM ROK PDU (iomrokpdu@iom.int) for more information.</div>","[""Immigration and Borders"",""Return and Reintegration Assistance"",""Objective 3: Facilitating Pathways for Regular Migration""]",,"[""Republic of Korea""]",,,,"IOM proposal template can be used","IOM's standard (A1) template is accepted by the donor",,"IOM standard reporting template is accepted",,,,"1/1/2025","12/31/2025",,,,"<div><a href=""https&#58;//www.moj.go.kr/moj_eng/index.do"">https&#58;//www.moj.go.kr/moj_eng/index.do</a><br></div>","5/14/2025 7:20 PM","MENKVELD Jordan","Approved"
"Switzerland","Highest Level","Government","Member State",,"0013X00003e9UGq","FERNANDEZ Berta","POTAUX VESY Claire","MICHIELS Lindsay Ann","<div>Switzerland is a federal state&#58; state power is
shared between the federal government, the cantons and the communes. The
cantons and communes have a&#160;broad scope in carrying out their
responsibilities, including integration of migrants and refugees. Federalism makes it possible for Switzerland to exist as one
entity – in spite of four linguistic cultures and varying regional
characteristics.&#160;Switzerland’s political landscape comprises many different parties, of
which none holds a majority at the&#160;federal level&#58; There is no majority or
opposition party in the country – neither in
Parliament nor in the Federal Council. In the 2023–2027 legislature period, 10
political parties are represented in the National Council. 7 of those are also
represented in the Council of States, 4 in the Federal Council. They differ in
their views on the role of the state, society and the economy. <p>Switzerland faces
growing challenges in its regional environment.&#160; M<a>igration still is a priority topic
for Switzerland’s foreign policy. In line with the strategic link between
international cooperation and migration policy, it is in Switzerland’s interest
to address the root causes of forced displacement and irregular migration.
Migration is an essential ingredient of economic development in and outside of
Switzerland and stimulates innovation and entrepreneurship. Switzerland has
strongly relied on labor migrants for its economic development in the past 150
years. Every fourth worker in Switzerland’s labor market is a foreign national.
Switzerland also boasts an impressive diaspora, with around 750,000 Swiss
nationals living abroad. Switzerland has thus an interest in an international
system of migration governance that leverages the productive potential of
regular migration and reduces the risks and costs associated with irregular,
unsafe and forced migration, on its own territory and elsewhere</a>&#160;.</p></div><div>Major crises have altered the international context in recent years. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine and its future reconstruction, the energy crisis, food insecurity, the debt burden, inflation, security concerns, and climate change all have a direct impact on developing countries, but also on Switzerland. In an increasingly volatile world, international cooperation (IC) strengthens Switzerland’s credibility and influence on the international stage. It promotes values that are Switzerland’s strengths&#58; the rule of law and democracy, the market economy, human rights, dialogue, solidarity, and international humanitarian law and principles. IC aims to end poverty and support sustainable development in its three economic, environmental and social dimensions. It contributes to UN’s 2030 Agenda, with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals.<br></div>","<div><div>Switzerland and IOM have a longstanding
collaboration, including being the host government of the IOM Headquarters and an&#160;influential
donor in the&#160;multilateral sphere.&#160;In 2023 Switzerland ranked 8th <a href=""https&#58;//eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https&#58;//www.eda.admin.ch/deza/en/home/sdc/portrait/figures-statistics/ch-performance-compared.html&amp;data=05%7c01%7cBFERNANDEZ%40iom.int%7cb33ed7d87b9f465b8e4608db47bfcb71%7c1588262d23fb43b4bd6ebce49c8e6186%7c1%7c0%7c638182661310846831%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000%7c%7c%7c&amp;sdata=I0xomYz3xsEWIfMnWwljjL5gg4VCTqJ%2BVYG/tmIqjb0%3D&amp;reserved=0"">comparing
the ODA/GNI ratio of all DAC member countries</a>, and ranked 10th in
absolute numbers.<p>The majority of Switzerland’s ODA contributions (CHF2.54 billion in 2023) are provided by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) also provides development funds (CHF389 million in 2023) to support companies with ecological and social goals, strengthen public institutions and for infrastructure projects in target countries.</p></div><div>Other Swiss government agencies, cantons and municipalities made up CHF450 million Swiss ODA in 2023.<p>Emergency humanitarian aid to alleviate the effects of disasters is also included in ODA accounting, but not military assistance.</p></div><div>A rising share of ODA payments are made in Switzerland to help house and integrate asylum seekers. This share rose to 28% of total ODA spending in 2022 and 2023 (CHF1.3 billion).<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has had a considerable impact on Switzerland’s foreign aid budget. Amid
concerns over military preparedness across Europe, the Swiss parliament chose
to significantly increase spending on defence – but at the expense of aid
overseas, among other expenditures.</p></div></div><div><div>The result&#58; for the 2025-2028 period, the international
cooperation budget, which includes development assistance and humanitarian aid,
amounts to CHF11.12 billion ($12.21 billion). That’s CHF151 million less than
what the government had requested, and less than what the country spent in
2021-2024.<p>Another consequence of the war is that Switzerland is now
spending far more on Ukraine than on any other partner country. Between
2022-2024, the government financed aid for Ukraine through supplementary
credits from parliament. Now it has decided to allocate CHF1.5 billion, or more
than 13% of the 2025-2028 foreign aid purse, to the Eastern European country.</p><p>The government says that supporting and reconstructing
Ukraine, a priority country for development assistance since 1999, is of strategic importance to Switzerland. In addition to aid, since the war began Switzerland has hosted a handful of international conferences on Ukraine,
including one in July 2022 focused on recovery that set the tone for similar
subsequent gatherings to shore up support for reconstruction.</p><p>As cuts loom, Swiss foreign aid spending continues to fall
short of the internationally agreed target of 0.7% of GDP, after reaching 0.6%
for the first time in 2023. By contrast, defence expenditure is on track to
reach 1% of GDP by 2032.</p></div></div>","<div>IOM&#160;missions looking to engage with CH on funding&#160;– even if local embassies –&#160;are advised to first&#160;reach out to IOM CH (<a href=""mailto&#58;iomdk@iom.int"">iombern@iom.int</a>)&#160;as this will facilitate&#160;provision of&#160;strategic guidance and allow IOM CH to&#160;maintain&#160;an&#160;up-to-date&#160;picture of CH's priorities.&#160;Likewise, IOM Missions are advised to&#160;keep&#160;IOM CH in copy&#160;when&#160;engaging with CH donors.</div><div><ul><li>CoM - Berta Fernandez-Alfaro, bfernandez@iom.int</li><li>Deputy CoM - Claire Potaux-Vesy, cpotaux@iom.int.&#160;</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>There are 3 main entities IOM engages with in Switzerland&#58;</div><div><ul><li>Swiss State Secretariat for Migration (SEM)&#58; This is IOM's institutional focal point, from whom we receive softly earmarked funding and earmarked funding.</li><li>Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC).</li><li>Swiss Federal Department Foreign (FDFA).</li></ul></div><div class=""ExternalClass9DBCB5F7077B497EB0341E99C8654A93""><div><p></p></div><div class=""ExternalClassB63E74EA928C49EEB795032C9753FED8""><div style=""font-family&#58;Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size&#58;11pt;color&#58;rgb(0, 0, 0);""><p></p></div></div></div>","[""Enabler: Workforce"",""Enabler: Data and Evidence"",""Immigration and Borders"",""Labour Migration, Integration and Social Cohesion"",""Return and Reintegration Assistance"",""Resettlement Assistance and Pathways"",""Migration Management Support (incl.

States (U.S.) is the world’s third-largest country by land area and population,
with approximately <a href=""https&#58;//www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045224"">340
million people</a> as of 2024. The country is a constitutional
federal republic with 50 states and a capital, Washington, D.C. It is one of
the world's largest and most influential economies, with a nominal GDP <a href=""https&#58;//data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US"">exceeding
$27 trillion</a> in 2023, driven by a diverse
range of industries, including technology, finance, healthcare, and
manufacturing.<p>The country has a
long history of immigration. The U.S. is home to more than <a href=""https&#58;//www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/international-migrant-stock"">52 million migrants</a> as of 2024, making up about 15 percent of the
country’s overall population. Since 2021, net international migration has been
the primary driver of U.S. population growth, helping to reverse the nation’s
declining growth rate and reach the highest rate since 2000 in 2024, <a href=""https&#58;//www.census.gov/library/stories/2024/12/population-estimates.html"">0.98%</a>. Migration accounted for all growth <a href=""https&#58;//www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states"">from 2022-2023</a> for the first time since 1850. In a country with an aging workforce,
migration will continue to be a key driver of labor force growth.</p><p>U.S.
public opinion on immigration remains <a href=""https&#58;//news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx"">deeply divided</a>.
While some believe immigration is good for the country, others see migration as
a threat. This polarization has been fed by gridlock in the U.S. Congress,
which has been unable to pass legislation reforming the U.S. immigration system
to meet changing economic, security, and humanitarian needs for the past 30
years. As a result, Presidents increasingly use executive actions to implement
policy priorities, which shift with each administration. U.S. immigration
policy now swings from left to right with each new administration, creating
uncertainty for migrants, international partners, and U.S.
communities.</p></div>","<div>The United States
(U.S.) has been the world’s top Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) provider
for decades. The U.S. dramatically scaled up its ODA
provision from 2021-2023,
providing $66 billion in 2023. In 2022, it was the leading donor of both
humanitarian assistance and bilateral aid to Africa, while its top bilateral
ODA recipient was Ukraine.<p>As of 2025, the new U.S. administration signaled that it
will significantly reduce ODA, immediately pausing all foreign aid
disbursements and terminating a majority of ongoing projects. The amount that
it will ultimately provide annually is still unclear, but&#160;a significantly reduced envelope should be anticipated through 2028.</p><p>The State
Department, which controls most of the aid budget, has further announced it
will only approve ODA that it determines contributes to U.S. security,
strength, or prosperity. The top aid priority, particularly in the Western Hemisphere,
is reducing irregular migration, while other focuses likely include targeted life-saving
humanitarian assistance and disaster response, some global health security, and
stabilization, with a narrower focus on countries deemed critical to U.S.
interests.</p></div>","<div>US donor entities have different field presence and slight variation in engagement between DC and Country office, for support on specific donor, please reach out to GO Washington DC Office&#58;<p><ul><li>PRM
