Key facts about Sweden.\nPhysical map of Sweden showing major cities, terrain, national parks, rivers, and surrounding countries with international borders and outline maps. Key facts about Sweden.\n\nSweden Maps & Facts - World Atlas\nHome\nEurope\nSweden\nMaps of Sweden\nCounties Map\nWhere is Sweden?\nOutline Map\nKey Facts\nFlag\nSweden, a Nordic nation in Northern Europe, covers an area of 450,295 sq. km.\nThe topography of the country is largely shaped by ice. During the last Ice Age, much of Sweden was covered by a thick layer of ice. By 6,000 BC, when that ice finally retreated (\nor melted\n) it left in its wake a deeply-indented coastline (\nin the south\n) with many islands, and innumerable lakes, rivers and streams spread across the entire country.\nAs observed on the physical map of Sweden, to the north (\nabove the Arctic Circle\n) Sweden is rugged with snow-covered mountains and thick forests. Central Sweden is dominated by lower mountains in the west that give way to heavily forested hills and ridges, dozens and dozens of rivers and an estimated 101,000 lakes. In the south, large lakes (some linked by canals) and widely cultivated plains stretch across the land.\nSweden's border with Norway is covered by the Scandinavian Mountains, or in Swedish, the Kolen (\nor Kjolen\n) Mountains. These are relatively low-level mountains, as Sweden's highest point, Kebnekaise, stands at just 2,111 meters (\nabout 7,000 ft.\n) It has been marked on the map by a yellow upright triangle.\nThe country has a 3,218 km (2,000 mi) long coastline to the east. Sweden's coastal areas include several small islands and reefs, especially in the east and southwest. Directly south of Stockholm (\na city of islands\n) are Gotland and Oland, Sweden's largest islands. White sandy beaches are common along the southern coastline.\nSignificant lakes include Siljan, Storsjom, Varern and Vattern, and with few exceptions, the balance of Sweden's lakes are on the small side.\nSweden's largest rivers include the Angerman, Eman, Indal, Lagan, Ljusnan, Lule, Osterdal, Skellefte, Storuman, Torne and Ume.\nThe lowest point in the country is Kristianstad at −2.41 m (−7.9 ft). It has been marked on the map by an inverted triangle.\nCounties of Sweden Map\nSweden (officially, the Kingdom of Sweden) is divided into 21 counties (\nIan\n) and 290 municipalities (\nkommuner\n).  In alphabetical order, these counties are: Blekinge, Dalarna, Gavleborg, Gotland, Halland, Jamtland, Jonkoping, Kalmar, Kronoberg, Norrbotten, Orebro, Ostergotland, Skane, Sodermanland, Stockholm, Uppsala, Varmland, Vasterbotten, Vasternorrland, Vastmanland and Vastra Gotaland. The municipalities are further divided into 2512 parishes (\nforsamlinger\n).\nWith an area of 450,295 sq. km, Sweden is the largest country in Northern Europe. It is also the 5\nth\nlargest country in Europe and the 3\nrd\nlargest country in EU. Located on the south-central east coast of Sweden is, Stockholm – the capital, the largest and the most populous city of Sweden. Stockholm is the cultural, administrative and economic center of Sweden. Stockholm is also Sweden’s financial capital. The city’s location establishes it as one of the world’s most beautiful and spectacular cities. On the west coast of Sweden is Gothenburg – the 2\nnd\nlargest city in Sweden.\nWhere is Sweden?\nSweden is a Northern European country located on the Scandinavian Peninsula. It is situated both in the Northern and Eastern hemispheres of the Earth.  Sweden is bordered by 3 countries: by Finland in the east; by Norway in the north and west; by Denmark in the southwest (via a bridge-tunnel through Oresund Strait). It is bounded by the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea in the east and south; and by the Skagerrak and Kattegat straits in the southwest. Sweden shares its maritime borders with Germany, Denmark, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.\nSweden Bordering Countries\n:\nFinland\n.\nRegional Maps\n:\nMap of Europe\nOutline Map of Sweden\nThe above map represents Sweden, a European country located in the Scandinavian Peninsula.

Area: 172,751 sq mi (447,425 sq km). Population: (2025 est.) 10,577,000. Capital:\nStockholm\n. The population is largely homogeneous, although there are Finnish and Sami (Lapp) minorities and 10% of the inhabitants are immigrants or their descendents. Language: Swedish (official). Religions: Christianity (predominantly Protestant; also Roman Catholic); also Islam. Currency: Swedish krona. Sweden has three traditional regions: mountainous Norrland covers about three-fifths of the country and has vast forests and large ore deposits; Svealand has undulating glacial ridges and contains most of the country’s 90,000 lakes; and Götaland comprises the stony Småland highlands and the rich Skåne plains. About 15% of Sweden lies north of the Arctic Circle. The economy is largely based on services, heavy industries, and international trade. Sweden has large deposits of iron ore; industries include mining, lumbering, steel manufacturing, and tourism. Agricultural products include grains, sugar beets, potatoes, and livestock. One of the world’s richest countries, Sweden is known for its comprehensive social welfare system. It is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary state with one legislative house; its head of state is the king, and the head of government is the prime minister. The first traces of human life in Sweden date from about 9000\nbce\n. During the\nViking\nera (9th–10th century\nce\n), the Swedes controlled river trade in eastern Europe between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea; they also raided western European lands. Sweden was loosely united and Christianized in the 11th–12th century. It conquered the Finns in the 12th century, and in the 14th century it united with Norway and Denmark under a single monarchy. Sweden broke away in 1523 under\nGustav I Vasa\n. In the 17th century it emerged as a great European power in the Baltic region, but its dominance declined after its defeat in the Second\nNorthern War\n(1700–21). It became a constitutional monarchy in 1809 and united with Norway in 1814; it acknowledged Norwegian independence in 1905. Sweden maintained its neutrality during both World Wars. It was a charter member of the UN but abstained from membership in\nNATO\nand did not join the\nEuropean Union\nuntil 1995. A new constitution drafted in 1975 reduced the monarch’s powers to those of a ceremonial chief of state. In 1997 Sweden began the controversial shutdown of its\nnuclear power\nindustry. By the early 21st century it had emerged as a European centre of telecommunications and information technology.\nMarshall Plan Summary\nMarshall Plan, (April 1948–December 1951), U.S.-sponsored program designed to rehabilitate the economies of 17 western and southern European countries in order to create stable conditions in which democratic institutions could survive.

Stockholm preserved and armed neutrality in both World Wars. Since then, Sweden has pursued a successful economic formula consisting of a capitalist system intermixed with substantial welfare elements. Sweden joined the EU in 1995, but the public rejected the introduction of the euro in a 2003 referendum. The share of Swedenâs population born abroad increased from 11.3% in 2000 to 20% in 2021.\nÂ\nTip\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\nDefinitions and Notes\nGeography\nLocation\nNorthern Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Bothnia, Kattegat, and Skagerrak, between Finland and Norway\nGeographic coordinates\n62 00 N, 15 00 E\nMap references\nEurope\nArea\ntotal:\n450,295 sq km\nland:\n410,335 sq km\nwater:\n39,960 sq km\ncomparison ranking\n:\ntotal 58\nArea - comparative\nalmost three times the size of Georgia; slightly larger than California\nArea comparison map\n:\nLand boundaries\ntotal:\n2,211 km\nborder countries (2):\nFinland 545 km; Norway 1,666 km\nCoastline\n3,218 km\nMaritime claims\nterritorial sea:\n12 nm (adjustments made to return a portion of straits to high seas)\nexclusive economic zone:\nagreed boundaries or midlines\ncontinental shelf:\n200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\nClimate\ntemperate in south with cold, cloudy winters and cool, partly cloudy summers; subarctic in north\nTerrain\nmostly flat or gently rolling lowlands; mountains in west\nElevation\nhighest point:\nKebnekaise South 2,100 m\nlowest point:\nreclaimed bay of Lake Hammarsjon, near Kristianstad -2.4 m\nmean elevation:\n320 m\nNatural resources\niron ore, copper, lead, zinc, gold, silver, tungsten, uranium, arsenic, feldspar, timber, hydropower\nLand use\nagricultural land:\n7.5% (2018 est.)\narable land: 6.4% (2018 est.)\npermanent crops: 0% (2018 est.)\npermanent pasture: 1.1% (2018 est.)\nforest:\n68.7% (2018 est.)\nother:\n23.8% (2018 est.)\nIrrigated land\n519 sq km (2013)\nMajor lakes (area sq km)\nfresh water lake(s):\nVanern - 5,580 sq km; Vattern - 1,910 sq km; Malaren - 1,140 sq km\nPopulation distribution\nmost Swedes live in the south where the climate is milder and there is better connectivity to mainland Europe; population clusters are found all along the Baltic coast in the east; the interior areas of the north remain sparsely populated\nNatural hazards\nice floes in the surrounding waters, especially in the Gulf of Bothnia, can interfere with maritime traffic\nGeography - note\nstrategic location along Danish Straits linking Baltic and North Seas; Sweden has almost 100,000 lakes, the largest of which, Vanern, is the third largest in Europe\nPeople and Society\nPopulation\n10,536,338 (2023 est.)\ncomparison ranking\n:\n88\nNationality\nnoun:\nSwede(s)\nadjective:\nSwedish\nEthnic groups\nSwedish 80.3%, Syrian 1.9%, Iraqi 1.4%, Finnish 1.4%, other 15%\n(2020 est.)\nnote:\ndata represent the population by country of birth; the indigenous Sami people are estimated to number between 20,000 and 40,000\nLanguages\nSwedish (official)\nmajor-language sample(s):\nThe World Factbook, den obestridliga kÃ¤llan fÃ¶r grundlÃ¤ggande information.

Swedish society is very gender equal, which is reflected in the countryâs public policies.Â  A generous leave policy and high-quality subsidized childcare allows mothers and fathers to balance work and family life. Swedenâs income-replacement-based parental leave policy encourages women to establish themselves in the workforce before having children.Â  In fact, Swedish women have one of the highest labor participation rates in Europe and one of its highest total fertility rates (TFR), the number of children women have in their lifetime.Â  Postponement of parenthood has increased steadily.Â  Since the late 1960s, marriage and divorce rates have declined, while non-marital cohabitation and births out of wedlock have increased rapidly. Swedenâs TFR has hovered for decades around 2, which is close to replacement level and among Europeâs highest.\nSweden experienced âthe great emigrationâ between 1850 and the 1930s when, faced with famines, approximately 1.5 million Swedes sought a better life in the Americas and Australia.Â  However, since World War II, Sweden has been a country of immigration. During World War II, thousands of refugees from neighboring countries worked in Swedish factories, agriculture, and forestry, replacing Swedish men who were called up for military service.Â  During the 1950s and 1960s, Sweden joined the Geneva Convention and granted permanent residence to refugees from the USSR and the Warsaw Pact countries. During this period, Sweden also welcomed labor migrants, mainly from Finland and other Nordic countries, who bolstered the tax base needed to fund the countryâs welfare programs.\nUntil 1971, labor migrants, particularly from Finland, southern Europe (including then Yugoslavia, Italy, and Greece) the Baltics, and Turkey, came to Sweden as its industries flourished.Â  Companies recruited many of the workers, but others came on their own. Swedenâs labor demand eventually decreased, and the job market became saturated. The government restricted the flow of labor migrants, putting an end to labor migration from non-Nordic countries in 1972. From then until the 1990s, inflows consisted largely of asylum seekers from the Middle East, the Balkans, and South America, as well as persons looking to reunite with family members already in Sweden.Â  The country began a new era of labor immigration in 2008, as companies were encouraged to hire non-EU workers.Â  Among the largest source countries have been India, Thailand, and China. As of 2020, over a quarter of Swedenâs population had a migrant background.\nAge structure\n0-14 years:\n17.26% (male 936,274/female 882,347)\n15-64 years:\n62.05% (male 3,346,891/female 3,190,608)\n65 years and over:\n20.69% (2023 est.)
