Under this project, IOM will contribute to improving livelihoods and living conditions of Syrian migrants and refugees living in and outside of camps in Turkey and improving social cohesion with their host communities, through :\na) Quick impact income Generating Small Conditional Grants/Equipment\nb) Provision of transportation services for people living in camps or outside camps\nc) Support the municipal services in Gaziantep and Sanliurfa",

As of 15 January 2016, the Government extended access to the labour market to those under TP, albeit with restrictions. The regulation is an important step for Syrian refugees to be self-sufficient and to reduce the risk of exploitation through informal labour. Despite the new regulation, the large number of refugees accessing social services has stretched national structures and capacity to the utmost, particularly in those areas which host a high proportion of Syrians such as the border provinces and towns.",
