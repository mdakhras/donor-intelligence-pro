(b) Who are the stakeholders? • Why is IOM best placed to address the problem? What is IOM's added value/comparative advantage in implementing the project? What special skills, knowledge and/or capacities does IOM have to justify its involvement? • Which other stakeholders would be involved in the project, and why are they required for the project to succeed? • Consider gender and age when identifying stakeholders and strive for stakeholders who are representative of the target population. (c) How will the project address the following cross-cutting themes of rights-based approach to programming, gender mainstreaming, environmental sensitivity and sustainability, sustainability of project results, principled humanitarian action and mainstreaming protection in crisis response?",
